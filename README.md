# Learn-ML-Basics

[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is a rapidly evolving field which focuses on computer algoritms that improve over expirience. The expirience can take the forms of training data, trial and error in a simulated enviorment, and a lot more.

My goal with this repository is to create an easy to follow and well paced program that relies on entirely online resources. I am not seeking to create a classification of all available resources on the topic, as there are many of those, and in order for them to be of any use one must already know the basics of the field.

As of now, this repository contains resources centered mostly around deep learning. I hope to add more as I learn and discover the field.
