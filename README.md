# Learn ML Basics

[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is a rapidly evolving field which focuses on computer algoritms that improve over expirience. The expirience can take the forms of training data, trial and error in a simulated enviorment, and a lot more.

My goal with this repository is to create an easy to follow and well paced program that relies on entirely online resources. I am not seeking to create a classification of all available resources on the topic, as there are many of those, and in order for them to be of any use one must already know the basics of the field.

As of now, this repository contains resources centered mostly around deep learning. I hope to add more as I learn and discover the field. I an in no way qualified for this as I am just a begginer, so this is more of a documentation of my learning proccess.

## Software and IDEs

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is currently the best language for those who are new to machine learning, as it enables to do a lot very simply. I recommend installing python 3.7 as it has the best library support at the date of writing this.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open source IDE that can be used with python using the python extension that can be installed from within the software. I find this IDE really simple and useful as it supports regular python script and ipynb notebooks.

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is an open source distribution of python that contains many of the basic ML libraries as well as many other useful ones. It is not necessary at all on a begginer level, but it has a few advantages such as great package managing as well as built in jupiter support.

## Prerequisits

To deeply understand the basic theory it is highly recommended (yet not necessary) to understand multivariably calculus and linear algebra matrix operations.

- [Essance of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

- [Essance of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

- [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrcCbdWwCBc&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC5feHa6Rc5c0wbRTx56nF7) (if you want you can stop at either 25 or 34)

## Theory

As ML and DL are very differnt paradigms than regular programming approaches, thare are many key concepts that need to be well understood in order to progress effectivly.

- [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) is a youtube series by 3Blue1Brown covering the basics of deep neural networks in detail. I highly recommend watching it and writing main ideas and equations as you do so.

- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) is a free online book that covers many of the same topics as the 3Blue1Brown series and more, with slight differences in notation and presentation. There is no need to read everything in order to get started with the programming.
